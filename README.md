# Hidden Markov Model-Based POS Tagger for Speech Understanding
This project implements a Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), designed to tackle part of the speech understanding problem. The goal is to label each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
